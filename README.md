# Project-BlogPost

1. Libraries used
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using any Python 3 version.


2. Motivation for the project
Since I love travelling and discovering new cities myself, I was interested in using the Airbnb data to better understand:

Is there a correlation between availability and prices of listings?
Is there a correlation between price and location of the listings in Seattle?
How strong did the amount of hosts grow in the last years?


3. Files in the repository with a small description of each
There is one notebook in this repository in which all neccessary steps are performed to answer the above questions. Additionally, I uploaded the three datasets that are used in this analysis.


4. Summary of the results of the analysis
The main findings of the analysis can be found at the blog post at:

5. Necessary acknowledgements
The data has been provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). I was using the README from the following Github repository as an inspiration: https://github.com/jjrunner/stackoverflow.
